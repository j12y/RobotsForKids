# LEGO Robotics Club

The LEGO Robotics Club at Robot Garden is for anybody old enough to read.  Fun
for both kids and parents, we will meet regularly to work on projects and
activities to learn robotics concepts and skills built on top of the LEGO
robotics platforms such as Mindstorms.

Based on member interest we will prepare for club challenges as well as form
teams for competitions such as Jr. FLL, FLL, and RoboGames (Lego Soccer,
TubePush, Bowling, Linefollow, etc.).

There is no charge currently and you don't need to be a Robot Garden member to
participate, but we may ask for donations at specific events to fund club LEGO
purchases.

More Information:
- [Books](resources/books.md): books to read for more information about projects, extensions, etc.
